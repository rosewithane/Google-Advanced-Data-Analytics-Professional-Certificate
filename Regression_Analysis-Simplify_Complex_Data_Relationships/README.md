# TikTok Project - Regression Modelling
## Project Overview:
As part of the Course 5 end-of-course portfolio in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate, this project focuses on building and evaluating a regression model to support TikTok’s claims classification initiative. The project simulates a real-world workplace scenario where TikTok is working to develop a predictive model that can differentiate between claims and opinions in user-reported content. This model is critical for improving the efficiency of moderating user reports and reducing backlog.

## Background:
TikTok allows users to submit reports flagging videos or comments that may require moderation. The volume of reports is large, making it challenging for moderators to process them in a timely manner. To solve this, TikTok’s data team is tasked with building a predictive model to help prioritize and automate the handling of these reports. My role in this project involves determining the best regression modeling approach, developing the model, and summarising the results for cross-departmental stakeholders.

## Project Deliverables:
- Regression Model Development: Determine the appropriate regression technique and build a model for claims classification.
- Model Evaluation: Check assumptions, evaluate model performance, and interpret the results.
- Communication: Summarise findings and share the results with both technical and non-technical stakeholders across various departments.
- Executive Summary: Provide a concise summary of the model’s performance and its implications for the claims classification task.

## Key Tasks:
Identify and apply the right regression method.
Validate and refine the model by checking assumptions and evaluating its performance.
Present model insights and recommendations to both technical (data scientists) and cross-functional (operations, finance, project management) team members.
