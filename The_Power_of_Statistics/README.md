# TikTok Project
## Project Overview:
This project is part of the Course 4 end-of-course portfolio in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The goal of the project is to apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing to a claims classification problem at TikTok. The project simulates a workplace scenario where TikTok’s data team is developing a predictive model to classify user reports on videos and comments. These reports need to be processed quickly and efficiently by moderators, and the development of this model will help reduce the backlog of reports.

## Background:
TikTok allows users to submit reports that flag videos and comments with claims, requiring moderation. To address the growing number of reports, TikTok’s data team is developing a predictive model to determine whether flagged content contains a claim or an opinion. My role in this project is to conduct hypothesis testing on the user claims dataset to assist in the claims classification model development.

## Project Deliverables:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Organise and analyse the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
- Hypothesis Testing: Determine and apply the appropriate hypothesis testing method for the claims classification dataset.
- Communication: Prepare insights to be shared with both technical team members (data scientists) and cross-functional team members (project managers, finance, and operations leads).
- Executive Summary: Create a concise summary of findings to present to stakeholders.

## Key Tasks:
Explore and clean the claims dataset.
Implement and interpret hypothesis testing results.
Communicate results effectively to stakeholders across different technical and non-technical teams.
