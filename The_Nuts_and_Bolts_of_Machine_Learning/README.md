# TikTok Project - Machine Learning
## Project Overview:
This project focuses on building and evaluating a machine learning model for TikTok’s claims classification initiative as part of the Course 6 end-of-course portfolio in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The goal is to finalize a predictive model to differentiate between claims and opinions in user-reported content, improving moderation efficiency.

## Background:
TikTok receives large volumes of user reports flagging videos or comments requiring moderation. To streamline this process, TikTok’s data team is developing a predictive model to prioritize and automate report handling. My role is to lead the final stages of model development, including feature engineering, model evaluation, and presenting results.

## Project Deliverables:
- Machine Learning Model Development: Build a model to support claims classification.
- Model Evaluation: Assess model performance and interpret results.
- Communication: Summarize findings for technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Executive Summary: Provide key insights and recommendations based on model outcomes.

## Key Tasks:
- Perform feature engineering and prepare the dataset.
- Build and evaluate the machine learning model.
- Present results and recommendations to both technical and cross-functional team members.
