# TikTok Project
## Project Overview:
This project involves a workplace scenario where I'll apply data analytics skills learned throughout the course. The goal is to create a project proposal to address a business question using the PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) framework.
## Background:
TikTok allows users to submit reports that flag videos and comments with claims, requiring moderation. To address the growing number of reports, TikTokâ€™s data team is developing a predictive model to determine whether flagged content contains a claim or an opinion. My role in this project is to conduct hypothesis testing on the user claims dataset to assist in the claims classification model development.

## Project Deliverables:

- Project proposal detailing key insights and recommendations.
- PACE strategy document.

## Key Tasks:
- Gather information about the business problem.
- Respond to questions in the PACE strategy document.
- Create a project proposal for cross-functional teams.
