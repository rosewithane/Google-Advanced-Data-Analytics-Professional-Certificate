# TikTok Project
## Project Overview:
This project is part of the Course 2 end-of-course portfolio in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The goal of the project is to apply foundational data analysis skills to a claims classification problem at TikTok. The project simulates a workplace scenario where TikTok’s data team is at the earliest stages of developing a predictive model to classify user reports on videos and comments. These reports need to be processed quickly and efficiently by moderators, and the development of this model will help reduce the backlog of reports.

## Background:
TikTok allows users to submit reports that flag videos and comments with claims, requiring moderation. To address the growing number of reports, TikTok’s data team is developing a predictive model to determine whether flagged content contains a claim or an opinion. My role Your role in this project is to build and organize the claims dataset, examine data types, and prepare descriptive statistics to assist the data team in the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process.

## Project Deliverables:

- PACE Strategy Document: Plan the project while considering audience members, teammates, key milestones, and the overall project goal.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Organize and analyze the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
- Communication: Prepare and present findings to both technical team members (data scientists) and cross-functional team members (project managers, finance, and operations leads).
- Executive Summary: Create a concise summary of findings to present to stakeholders.

## Key Tasks:
- Build a dataframe for the claims classification data.
- Examine and summarize data types for each column.
- Conduct descriptive statistical analysis to understand the dataset.
- Organize claims data for exploratory data analysis.
- Communicate progress and insights effectively to the TikTok team.
